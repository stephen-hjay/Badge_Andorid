## User Manual   
Setting up the APP and devices:   
•	A QR code should be attached to the back of each device to allow other devices to identify it.   
•	Every test should start with devices fully charged.   
•	Before installing the APP to an Android cellphone, the parameters like transmission rate and MAC address in the “GlobalVariables.java” file should be modified according to the needs.

## After starting the APP:   
•	The admin needs to login with the username and password and fill in dataset ID and user ID to label the test and device user.   
•	After the APP is launched and login, a user should wear the device in front of his or her chest, with the back side (QR code) facing the outside.   
•	While the APP is running, no buttons may be touched.   
Finally, all data will be collected on the server side.
